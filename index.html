  In the history of internet culture, <strong>trolls</strong> have become symbols of provocation, humor, and irony. It all started with the legendary <em>“Trollface”</em> meme, which first appeared in 2008 and was created by <strong>Carlos Ramirez</strong>. This character became an icon of deliberate jokes designed to provoke strong reactions. Now, in the era of <strong>Web3 and memecoins</strong>, the troll figure has made a comeback as a symbol of unpredictable communities that often defy expectations. Troll memes are not just jokes — they represent a digital rebellion against the mainstream. This project is a tribute to the cultural power of trolls in the age of social media. Below, you'll find a collection of the most <strong>viral</strong>, <strong>legendary</strong>, and <strong>hilarious</strong> troll images from the internet — completely <strong>free</strong> and used by millions of people around the world.
